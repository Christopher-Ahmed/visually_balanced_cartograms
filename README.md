# Visually Balanced Cartograms

Visually Balanced Cartograms (VBC's) are both a method, as well as a mapping type. I am not the inventor of this method, but I find them very useful and interesting and have decided to spend a portion of my paternity leave exploring them. I have choosen to create this github repository to use as a diary, or exploration log. I wish to begin my first entry with a link to the article that introduced me VBC's pubished in the [Jornal of Maps, volume 14 (2018) by European scholars Richard Harris, Martin Charlton, and Chris Brundson](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2018.1478753). Found in the references are four other related works by Richard Harris. My first step in exploring VBC's will be to review these journal articles. At this point, I am not sure what will come out of my exploration; perhaps this effort will only satisfy my curiosity and provide me with the information to make useful VBC's, perhaps as a result I can create some how-to instructions so others can use the VBC's method, or perhaps this exploration will result in ideas for adding to the VBC's as a methodology that I can publish here on GitHub and/or peer reviewed journal.

The paper quickly identifies the problem VBC's will solve: the problem of (1) invisibility - think map of census tract map of state, some tracts are so small you can't see them, and (2) distorition - think of a typical cartogram map, the original geography is usually distored so much you can't tell where you are spatially.
